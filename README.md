## yt2010comments.user.css

**Please note that it's currently still in Alpha, so things might be broken or unfinished.**

This user style file is supposed to bring back the style of the old YouTube comments section style (around 2010 to 2012).
It requires the Vorapis 3 extension to function, and it works best with StarTube's Aozora, Epic Panda or Cosmic Panda layouts with expCommentsFullWidth turned off.
The current version is: 1621 (21 June 2024).

> Buncha more changes to make it more accurate.
