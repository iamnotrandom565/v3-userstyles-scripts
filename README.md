## yt2010comments.user.css

**Please note that it's currently still in Dev, so things might be broken or unfinished.**

This user style file is supposed to bring back the style of the old YouTube comments section style (around 2010 to 2012).
It requires the Vorapis 3 extension to function, and it works best with StarTube's Aozora, Epic Panda or Cosmic Panda layouts with expCommentsFullWidth turned off.

## ytcosmicchannels.user.css

**Please note that since the next StarTube update will include Cosmic Panda-styled channel pages, this will become obsolete soon.**

**Please also note that it's really unfinished, please report bugs in Issues**
