## yt2010comments.user.css

**Please note that it's currently still in Alpha, so things might be unfinished.**

This user style file is supposed to bring back the style of the old YouTube comments section style (around 2010 to 2012).
It requires the Vorapis 3 extension to function, and it works best with StarTube's Aozora, Epic Panda or Cosmic Panda layouts.
The current version is: 1206 (20 June 2024).

### Version history

- **Alpha 1206** First version
- **Alpha 1206.2** Added a bunch of changes under the hood (note that it has a bug that places the reply button to the bottom)
