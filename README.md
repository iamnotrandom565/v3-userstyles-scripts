## channels2a.user.css

*Please note that it's in Alpha, so stuff might be broken or absent. Before reporting a bug, please check the bottom of the code.*

This user style is supposed to bring back Channels2A, used from 2006 to 2009.
Before you use this user style, you first need to install Vorapis 3 (just go to vorapis.pages.dev, and follow the instructions). Then, install an userscript manager (like Tampermonkey), and install StarTube. Finally, go to the StarTube settings, and enable Channels3, or select a layout from Early 2013 to 2008.

_The current version is: Alpha 1116 (November 6 2024)._

## ytstargazerplayer.user.css

*Please note that it's in Alpha, so stuff might be broken or absent. Before reporting a bug, please check the bottom of the code.*

This user style is supposed to bring back YouTube's Stargazer video player (used from 2008 to 2010).
Before you use this user style, you first need to install Vorapis 3 (just go to vorapis.pages.dev, and follow the instructions). Then, enable the Flash7 player, which is located in the "Video player" menu. It fits well with the 2008-2009 layouts from StarTube Beta.
